I thought Iâ€™d start a collection of works that relate to the concept of [critical instruments](https://critical-instruments.Digitalmedia-bremen.de/).

I have decided to use a [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) policy for images, films, quotes, and other media types i.e i will download media where possible and store it in the `assets` folder of this repository, i will, however, preserve the original source URL in the `alt` tag and will refer to the source in the caption with the following *idiom*:

```
@source([Title](https://link.to.source), @date(YYYY-MM-DD))
```

i hope and believe that this is *fair*.
